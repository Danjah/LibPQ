# LibPQ - a collection of reusable modules for Power Query M Language

This project offers a collection of functions and useful queries for Power
Query Formula Language (also known as M language) and a loader to import source
code from external modules into Power Query.

### Feature highlights

- Import source code from plain text files located on disk or on the web
- Unlimited number of import locations ordered by priority
- [Unit testing][unittesting] framework
- Show [docstrings] in Power Query user interface
- A collection of general purpose [functions and queries][modules]
- Compatibility with [@tycho01's library][tycho01]

### More information

- Introductory overview is available at [author's blog][intro]
- [Documentation][docs] describes some more specific use cases
- [Release notes](RELEASES.md) contain important information on latest LibPQ changes
- [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) describes project vision and plans for the future

# Installation and usage

### Copy source code to the filesystem (optional)

Download the [contents of this repo][zip] and extract it anywhere you want. If
you skip this step you will not be able to list all available modules with
`LibPQ()` call and every time you load a module LibPQ will access the network.

### Add LibPQ to the workbook

Create two blank queries in your workbook:

- **LibPQ** - copy the contents of [LibPQ.pq](LibPQ.pq) verbatim
- **LibPQPath** - provide location of modules source code (local and/or web).
  See sample at [LibPQPath-sample.pq](LibPQPath-sample.pq)

### Import LibPQ modules when writing your queries

Import any of the available modules via `LibPQ("modulename")` when writing your
queries in Advanced Editor.

To import all modules available locally use `LibPQ()` with no arguments (or
`null`). That will return a record where keys are module names and values are
the results of loading those modules (function object or output of a query).

# LibPQ modules
All modules are grouped into namespaces, much like the standard library:

- **Date** - Functions for working with dates
- **Factory** - Functions that create other functions
- **Folder** - Access folder listings and folder contents
- **List** - Functions for working with lists
- **Module** - LibPQ tools for importing source code
- **Read** - Functions that import data
- **Table** - Functions for table operations
- **Tests** - Unit tests for LibPQ modules
- **Text** - Functions for working with text
- **[UnitTest][unittesting]** - Unit testing framework

Detailed [module list][modules] is available in documentation, and each module
has a clear description in the comment at the top of its source file.

[unittesting]: Docs/UnitTesting.md

# Compatibility with @tycho01's library

LibPQ allows specifying multiple possible locations for source code, that's why
you can add [@tycho01's library][tycho01] as a fallback.

Any module from that library should be supported, though some will require
adding a `Load` query to your workbook. To create a `Load` alias for `LibPQ`
you need to:

- Create a new blank query
- Replace all its code with text `LibPQ`
- Save the query under the name `Load`

Now the `Load` function will be available from `#shared` context, and you
should be able to import any module from [@tycho01's library][tycho01].
